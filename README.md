How to run the testcases:
`python sokoban.py inputFileName outputFileName`

Example:
`python sokoban.py testcases/test1.xsb result.xsb`

*This is the best sokoban solver that you can find on the github*

Every file contains one test case.
test1.xsb to test6.xsb namely contain the 6 testcases mailed by Harish Sir.
Our code is working just fine for the first 5 testcases out of 6.
The result for each testcase is being stored in the result.xsb file.
The result.xsb contains the output of the better performing algorithm out of A* and UCS.
